                About:  

                
                This website aims strictly for safety measures in any case of a natural disaster such as floods, earthquakes and
                strong typhoons. This will help educate others on what they can do if the situation allows them to, worst case 
                scneraio a majority of people tend to panic in fear at the worst times. But you? You won't. You'll be prepared,
                ready to face disaster head on! Though I don't guarantee the stuff here will work 100% of the time, think of it
                as more of a guide on what you CAN do, and not what you HAVE to do. 

                Head over to the CATEGORIES section and take a pic on what you're interested in, it should be enough to fill 
                you on the more common disaster types around the area, or so thats what the Radar suggests... The information
                provided will suffice on your preparation, its only a matter of how you'll implement them.

                REMEMBER! At times of crisis, hesitation won't save you or anyone. Stay cool, and keep going. You'll thank
                yourself later.
